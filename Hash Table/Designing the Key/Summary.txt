  Design the Key - Summary
Report Issue
Here are some takeaways about how to design the key for you.

When the order of each element in the string/array doesn't matter, you can use the sorted string/array as the key.
If you only care about the offset of each value, usually the offset from the first value, you can use the offset as the key.
In a tree, you might want to directly use the TreeNode as key sometimes. But in most cases, the serialization of the subtree might be a better idea.
In a matrix, you might want to use the row index or the column index as key.
In a Sudoku, you can combine the row index and the column index to identify which block this element belongs to.
Sometimes, in a matrix, you might want to aggregate the values in the same diagonal line.
