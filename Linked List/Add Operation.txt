  Add Operation - Singly Linked List
Report Issue
If we want to add a new value after a given node prev, we should: 

Initialize a new node cur with the given value;
Link the "next" field of cur to prev's next node next;
Link the "next" field in prev to cur.
Unlike an array, we donâ€™t need to move all elements past the inserted element. Therefore, you can insert a new node into a linked list in O(1) time complexity, which is very efficient.

 

An Example


Let's insert a new value 9 after the second node 6.

We will first initialize a new node with value 9. Then link node 9 to node 15. Finally, link node 6 to node 9.

After insertion, our linked list will look like this:



 
Add a Node at the Beginning
As we know, we use the head node head to represent the whole list.

So it is essential to update head when adding a new node at the beginning of the list.

Initialize a new node cur;
Link the new node to our original head node head.
Assign cur to head.
For example, let's add a new node 9 at the beginning of the list.

We initialize a new node 9 and link node 9 to current head node 23.
Assign node 9 to be our new head.
